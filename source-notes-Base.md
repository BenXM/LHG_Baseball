## Game Flow ?!?!? ##

An excerpt:
- "the pitch is in there"
- Strike three!

But it's only the first strike?
Similar behavior with balls?


## Offense Menu ##
	
*Personnel --> "Relief Pitcher"*
- is only letting you know pitcher status 
- this is b/c he's not up for relief

*"HIT AND RUN"*
only can use in certain circumstances?
